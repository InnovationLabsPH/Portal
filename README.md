# **Sorsogon Community Innovation Labs Portal**  

Hello, Portal!  

## **How to Contribute?**  

### Step 1: Set up your local development environment 
Before you start, install the necessary tools to start working on the project.

#### Example:
- Nodejs
- Python
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub Desktop

### Step 2: Clone the repo
Cloning means downloading the project to your computer. 

#### Using VSCode:
1. Select "**Clone Repository**" from the Source Control Tab:

2. Copy the repository clone url into **vscode**:

It might prompt you to login with your github account first if you aren't logged in. 

After that it will just prompt you where to download the repository and you'll be good to go.

It might be a good idea to create a **git** folder where all of your other cloned repository will be placed.

### Step 3: Create or select a branch
A branch lets you work on new features or fixes without affecting the main project. When creating a branch use a descriptive name that clearly indicates what you are working on.

#### How to create a branch:
1. From the upper left corner of GitHub, click **main** just beside **Branch**.

2. In the search bar, type the name of your new branch. A "**Create branch ...**" option should appear below.

3. Click "**Create branch**" and it should automatically create and switch to the new branch.

You successfully created a new branch!!!

#### How to select a branch:
1. Inside **vscode**, navigate to the **Source Control** tab. Make sure that the project repository you will be working on is open/active inside the editor.

2. Press the **pull** command to fetch updates from the remote repository including newly created **branches**.
- If a branch you created is missing the you probably haven't **pulled** the update into your local repo.

### Step 4: Make changes
- Commit and push your code changes to the branch you cloned.
- Ideally to it periodically to have savepoints and to backup your progress.
- TODO

### Step 5: Submit for review
- When you're satisfied with your work, create a **pull request (PR)** to request a code review for all of your commits.
- TODO 

### Step 6: Cleanup
- When the task is done and passed for the code review and the changes are merged into the main branch, delete the branch that you created to fully clean things up.
- TODO
  
Happy coding! hehe
