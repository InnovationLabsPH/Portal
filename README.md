### Step 1: Set up your local development environment  
Before you start, install the necessary tools to start working on the project.

#### Example:  
- Nodejs    
- Visual Studio Code  
- GitHub Desktop
- Others...

---

### Step 2: Clone the repo  
Cloning means downloading the project to your computer.  

#### Using VSCode:  
1. Select "**Clone Repository**" from the Source Control Tab:  

   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab3787a7-1a45-4288-8787-4271fa1ea66e" />

2. Copy the repository clone url into **vscode**:  

   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d01ee8-5ce4-4d7f-aa93-5378fdce0332" />

   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd6227cc-c5ab-4023-8f2e-a1da31c3f1c9" />

It might prompt you to log in with your GitHub account first if you aren't logged in.  

After that, it will just prompt you where to download the repository and you'll be good to go.  

It might be a good idea to create a **git** folder where all of your other cloned repositories will be placed.

### Step 3: Create or select a branch  
A branch lets you work on new features or fixes without affecting the main project. When creating a branch, use a descriptive name that clearly indicates what you are working on.

#### How to create a branch:  
1. From the upper-left corner of GitHub, click **main** just beside **Branch**.

2. In the search bar, type the name of your new branch. A "**Create branch ...**" option should appear below.  

   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6fa1368-21df-411a-b39b-e0eb229cc4b8" />

3. Click "**Create branch**" and it should automatically create and switch to the new branch.

You successfully created a new branch!!!  

#### How to select a branch:  
1. Inside **VSCode**, navigate to the **Source Control** tab. Make sure that the project repository you will be working on is open/active inside the editor.

2. Press the **pull** command to fetch updates from the remote repository, including newly created **branches**.  
   - If a branch you created is missing, you probably haven't **pulled** the update into your local repo.

3. Click the "**Auto**" button to select which branch you would like to work on.

4. It should now list all the available branches. Feel free to select the branch you would be working with and press **OK**.

You successfully switched to your selected branch!!!

### Step 4: Make changes  
- Commit and push your code changes to the branch you cloned.  
- Ideally, do it periodically to have savepoints and to back up your progress.  
- TODO  

---

### Step 5: Submit for review  
- When you're satisfied with your work, create a **pull request (PR)** to request a code review for all of your commits.  
- TODO  

### Step 6: Cleanup  
- When the task is done and passed for the code review and the changes are merged into the main branch, delete the branch that you created to fully clean things up.  
- TODO  

Happy coding! hehe
